# __Python Projects Profolio__

This is a collection of the python projects that I have as part of my portfolio thus far, these vary from smaller code snippets to larger programs. They are developed in either Jupyter Notebook or Visual Studio Code.

### __SORTING ALGORITHMS__ [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/python_portfolio/blob/master/Sorting_Algorithms/Sorting%20Algorithms.py)
---
I did this as I was studying computer science at the time and was learning about sorting algorithms while also learning Python online. So I decided to work on coding the three core sorting algorithms insertion, bubble and sort by getting them to sort a python list. This shows the use of loops, conditional statements and try / except blocks.

 &nbsp;
### __FIZZBUZZ__ [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/python_portfolio/blob/master/FizzBuzz_Python/FizzBuzz.py)
---
My python version of the famous FizzBuzz problem where we ask the user for a whole number and we output all numbers that are either divisable by 3 or 5 and BOTH 3 and 5 upto and including the entered number, I also implement some try / except blocks of code here.

&nbsp;
### __BINARY NUMBER CALCULATOR__ [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/python_portfolio/blob/master/Binary_Number_Calculator/Binary%20Number%20Calculator.py)
---
While I was learning python online I was also learning computer science and one of the things I was studying was binary mathematics, so again I combined the two things together and developed a program that can convert from binary to decimal and vice versa.

&nbsp;
### __BLACKJACK GAME__ [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/python_portfolio/blob/master/Milestone_Pro_Blackjack/Milestone%20Project%202.ipynb)
---
One of the main projects I undertoook was to develop a working game of blackjack using python. This shows the of understanding of object-orientated programming by creating an object for the individual playing card, the deck of cards, the playing hand itself and also for the number of chips the player has. The player can bet, hit or stand. The program also shows the use of loops, conditional statements, functions and classes.

### __VIDEOGAME DATABASE__ [(CODE)](https://github.com/ProfSFrink/python_portfolio/blob/master/Capstone_Pro_VG_dB_Project/vg_database.py)
---
For the final project of my online python course, I chose to make a command-line database program as I wanted to focus on python data structures, object-orientated programming and file-handling, so developed this application that I can use to track my videogame collection.

I create a classes to represent each individual game, each individual platform and then have a simple list for each type of game genere. I store the games as a list of instances of the game class, with the platform a dictionary of k / v pairs with the value being an instance of the platform class. Then for file-handling I import the pickle library and also make use of the os library to be able to clear the screen. The main application is self-uses most excepted python features such as conditional operators, loops, lists and dictionaries, try / except blocks. I also define colours as a class so the interface can use different coloured text.

The inital completed project allowed for the addition, editing and viewing of games within the database I would like to return to the project and implement deletion of games and platforms and also seperate the code in modules to aid with structure and readbility.
